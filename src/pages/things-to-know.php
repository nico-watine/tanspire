								<h3>Before Your Visit</h3>
								<p>To help insure superior tanning results, clients should prepare by reading the below information before coming in for their airbrush session :</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Shower and exfoliate prior to all airbrush sessions.  We recommend using the Infinity Sun Skin Exfoliating Skin Renewal</li>
									<li>Shaving and waxing should be performed before coming in for your session. Razor blades should be replaced before shaving after sunless tanning to avoid stripping the newly tanned skin</li>
									<li>Avoid using lotions, creams, and makeup (eye makeup is ok) prior to your session</li>
									<li>Remove jewelry</li>
									<li>Tie long hair up away from face and neck</li>
									<li>Attire to wear for your session: Bring a dark-colored bathing suit (or a garment of preference) or you may use disposable garments that are available at TanSpire<span class="tmSymbol"><small>&trade;</small></span>.  The Infinity Sun cosmetic bronzer washes out of most clothing very easily, but can stain wool, silk, light nylon, and other light synthetic materials</li>
									<li>Attire to bring for after your session: Bring dark-colored, loose fitting clothing as well as flip-flops or sandals to wear in order to avoid any possible contact with sweat on the feet</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>After Your Visit</h3>
								<p>Clients who take exceptional care of their skin will have longer lasting results.  Here are a couple of tips for achieving a lasting beautiful tan:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Wait at least 8 hours before showering, bathing, swimming, moisturizing, or partaking in any strenuous activity that could cause sweating </li>
									<li>While the tan is developing, wear dark, loose-fitting clothing (about 8 hours) </li>
									<li>Use a gel based, moisturizing soap (not bar soap) when showering/bathing and when drying gently pat dry the skin </li>
									<li>Use only new razors to gently shave the skin </li>
									<li>Apply Infinity Sun Extend or Extend with Shimmer daily (preferably at night) to help keep skin hydrated, smooth, and to prolong tanning results </li>
									<li>Apply non-tanning moisturizer twice a day </li>
									<li>Avoid exfoliating skin or products that exfoliate the skin such as AHA, BHA, anti-aging products, etc. </li>
									<li>Avoid spraying perfume/body sprays onto the tanned area of the skin </li>
									<li>Avoid makeup removers </li>
									<li>Use Infinity Sun Glow on the Go Sunless Tanner to touch up face, hands and feet between sessions.</li>
								</ul>
